# Prusa i3 Full Upgrade MK3

## Assembly Instructions

### Step 5


#### Parts  

* 4x Self tapping screws
* 2x 359mm v-slots

#### Assembly
The 359mm v-slots should be able receive a screw in the center hole of one end later in the build. For this purpose we need a thread inside the extrusion hole. The end caps attached to this are purely aesthetic though, so you can decide to skip this step if you don't have the correct tools at hand.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Check the ends of the 359mm v-slots. If your bought a kit, they might be pre-tapped. In that case, continue to the [Next Step](step06.md).

:heavy_exclamation_mark: If you know how to tap a hole, use M5x8mm and M5 tap instead of self tapping screw. tap the center hole and continue to the [Next Step](step06.md).

1. We will pre-tap v-slot with self tapping screw to add Z axis end caps later in the assembly
1. :warning: When using these self-tapping screws, you will want to back the screw out and drill it in a little deeper each time. This helps to clear the hole of the cuttings and allows the tapping process to work more easily. Use a drill/driver if it is too hard.
1. (Optional) Add a bit of generic oil on the self tapping screws
1. On one side of each v-slots, insert carefully the self tapping screws until the head is touching the v-slot (figure 5.1)
1. Unscrew self tapping screws and reserve them for later
1. Clean up v-slots from oil and aluminum residues
